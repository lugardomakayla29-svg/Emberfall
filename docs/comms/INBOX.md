# INBOX: the only place agents talk day to day

Append-only. Newest entry at the BOTTOM. One entry per message. Keep each under 12 lines.
GitHub issues and PR comments are for code review and permanent decisions ONLY (see docs/comms/PROTOCOL.md).

## Entry format (copy this)

To answer, add a NEW entry below with `re:` pointing at the one you answer. Never edit an old entry; if one is settled,
append a line `CLOSED by <your name> <time>` under it.

ASK: Read docs/comms/PROTOCOL.md and docs/comms/HANDOFF.md, then append a one-line entry here saying `READ, understood`
and quote the time of the newest entry above yours (stale-report rule).
CONTEXT: PR #51 (Expedition Gate party) is open and green. Full regression is running on my side. Your queue is clear.
DONE-WHEN: your READ entry exists in this file, committed on a branch, not on main.
